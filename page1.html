                <p>this wibsite is disght to help every haitian peopl who want to do goood in their country. this the safest way to buil back in your comminoty where you came from. our plaform have disighed to best perffo jkdkjkj jdka Each year, over $500 billion of value is transferred cross-border through personal remittances. In most cases, remittances are transfers of money from foreign workers to family members in their home country, sent on a monthly basis. High fees to use traditional Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), like Moneygram, are often paid by those who can afford it least – the 1.7 billion unbanked adults in the world. And those costs impact not only the sender and receiver – they also impact businesses wanting to provide speedy, affordable remittance services to these under-served demographics.</p>

                <p> Because there are so many steps involved in using legacy financial systems and moving value through emerging market economies, costs have remained high. Today, remittance service providers, digital money apps, growing fintech companies, and remote traditional banks can use Stellar to reduce the friction and costs associated with traditional MTOs, correspondent banks, and financial payment rails.   
                    The vast majority of international bank money transfers are executed through SWIFT. Founded in Brussels in 1973, the Society for the Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, was established to promote standards for global interactivity and financial transfers. Furthermore, SWIFT is the most popular type of international bank transfer used today.</p>
                    
                <p> The SWIFT transfer process involves sending computerized messages from one bank to another indicating that funds have been paid or received by the receiving bank and also acts as a guarantee or promissory note to the receiving bank. Member institution banks are provided with a specific SWIFT code or bank identifier code. In general, SWIFT codes are eight characters long and are unique to the member banking institution. SWIFT bank transfers are considered to be among the most secure and safest available, and that is why more than 75% of the banks in the world you SWIFT as their international bank transfer protocol. </p>

                    While SWIFT is certainly the most common form of international bank transfer, there are other less used protocols such as the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) that are used. In addition there are many private services that act as transfer agents and accept remittance payments for delivery to overseas recipients. Twp of the most popular of these types of cash transfer agencies today are Western Union and Moneygram. The services these companies provide is very similar to banks when it comes to international money transfers.
